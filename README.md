# Weather App

This is the [Weather App project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app) from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Javascript Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/).

To use the app, a user enters a city name.  A fetch request is made to the [api backend](https://github.com/esteban90-dev/weather-app-backend) that forwards a request to the [openweathermap api](https://openweathermap.org/current).  Once the fetch request is returned with weather data, it is displayed on the page.  The user can choose to display the temperature in either Celsius or Fahrenheit.
